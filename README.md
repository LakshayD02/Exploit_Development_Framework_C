# Exploit Development Framework / Fuzzing Tool

This C-based exploit development framework serves as a fuzzing tool designed to test the robustness and security of applications by generating random payloads and targeting potential vulnerabilities. It automates the process of sending these payloads to a specified target, allowing developers and security researchers to identify weaknesses and improve application resilience against attacks.

# Key Features:

- Random Payload Generation:

The framework generates random binary payloads of specified sizes, which are critical in testing how well a target application can handle unexpected or malformed inputs. The random payloads are generated as arrays of unsigned characters, simulating various potential attack vectors.

- Structured Payloads:

It creates structured payloads encapsulated in a Payload structure, which contains both the size of the payload and the actual data. This encapsulation allows for better organization and management of the fuzzing data.

- Fuzzing Mechanism:

The fuzzing process is controlled by a FuzzingContext structure that specifies the target application, the number of fuzz iterations, and the size of each payload. Users can customize the fuzzing iterations and payload sizes through command-line arguments, providing flexibility in testing scenarios.

- Target Interaction:

The tool contains a dedicated function to simulate interaction with the target application during fuzzing. The fuzzTarget function logs the fuzzing operation details, including the target application name, data size, and the actual data being sent, thus enabling easy tracking of what was tested.

- Vulnerability Exploitation:

In addition to fuzzing, the framework includes functionality for exploiting vulnerabilities using the generated payloads.
The exploitVulnerability function provides a simulated environment where the tool attempts to exploit the target using a specified payload, enhancing the testing capabilities.

- Memory Management:

The framework manages memory efficiently by dynamically allocating space for payloads and ensuring proper cleanup after usage to prevent memory leaks.
